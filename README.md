# Book Struct

This Cadence program is a simple smart contract that demonstrates how to create, store, and access custom data structures on the Flow blockchain. The purpose of this program is to serve as an example of how to use Cadence, the resource-oriented programming language for smart contracts.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Cadence, a programming language that introduces new features to smart contract programming that help developers ensure that their code is safe, secure, clear, and approachable. The contract defines a struct named Book, which has properties such as title, journal, issue and volume. The contract also defines a dictionary with type {String: Book}, which stores the books by their title. The contract provides a function to add books to the dictionary using a transaction, and a function to read the value of the dictionary using a script.


### Executing program

To run this program, you can use the Flow Playground, an online Cadence IDE. To get started, go to the Flow Playground website at https://play.onflow.org/.

Once you are on the Flow Playground website, create a new project by clicking on the "New Project" button in the top-right corner. Name your project "Book" and click on the "Create" button.

In the left-hand sidebar, you will see four tabs: Contract, Transaction, Script, and Test. Click on the Contract tab and paste the codes.
